Hello welcome to my blog.
</h1>
<h2>
	I have began this to track all of my progress and to see how far I can come after time passes.
</h2>
<br><br><br>
<p>
On the first day of coding I created <a target="_blank" href="https://godawgs.netlify.app/" style="color:#0f59f0">THIS</a> website. It was kind of bad but I learned a lot from it.<br>
Ever since the beginning I have been using Khan Academy's program to learn to code. I have<br>
loved coding for about 6 months but never wanted to indulge in it. Ever since I have I cannot<br>
stop, I do it at school, I do it everywhere I can possibly. I love coding so much and just want<br>
to keep learning everything. My mom is the one who encuraged me to start so thanks to her.<br>
I am glad to say that I am beginning more advanced CSS now and will have better formatting<br>
now!
